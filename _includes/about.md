I am Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, and this is my website.

I am a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), a US
Department of Energy research facility. Working alongside a team of hardware
engineers and scientists, I develops and analyzes new parallel programming
models for exascale and post-Moore architectures. Bryce is one of the
developers of the HPX C++ runtime system.

I spent five years working on HPX while at Louisiana State University's Center
for Computation and Technology. I also helped start the LLVMLinux initiative,
and has occasionally contributed to the Boost C++ libraries.

I am passionate about C++ community development: he is the Program Chair of the
C++Now and CppCon conferences and he is an organizer of the Bay Area C++ user
group. He serves as LBNL's representative to the ISO C++ standard committee.
